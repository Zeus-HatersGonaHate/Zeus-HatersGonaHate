# Zeus Reviews

> A movie and TV review website focused around a social atmosphere. We encourage users to be positive within their reviews, and provide constructive feedback, rather than purely negative feedback. We would like to be able to contribute to the movie community, by providing helpful consumer insights on what is in demand. Our website allows users to write reviews, which can then be rated based on usefulness.

## Development

Developed using the MEAN stack, Zeus Reviews uses Node and Express on the backend to handle server requests. MongoDB and Mongoose power our database, where we store user profiles and information about movie reviews. The front-end is fueled by Angular, and displays data dynamically based on the data returned from the API calls. APIs and additional services currently in use include: TheMovieDB API, OMDB API, OnConnect Data Delivery API, and Auth0.

### Installing Dependencies
